- **Web-Compatible Icons**: Custom icon component using emoji fallbacks
- **Filtering System**: Integration with CategoryFilter and CitySelector components
- **Campaign Listing**: Display of filtered collaboration opportunities
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly with proper semantic structure

### ðŸš§ Planned Enhancements
- **Interactive Map**: Google Maps or Leaflet integration
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live campaign updates
- **Advanced Search**: Text-based search functionality
- **Geolocation**: User location detection and nearby campaigns

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
MapScreen.web.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ WebIcon (Custom icon component)
â”œâ”€â”€ Header (Logo + Controls)
â”œâ”€â”€ Filters (City + Category selectors)
â”œâ”€â”€ Main Content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Desktop Layout (Map + List side-by-side)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Mobile Layout (Stacked)
â””â”€â”€ Results Counter
```

### Data Flow
1. **Load Campaigns**: Fetch from CampaignRepository
2. **Apply Filters**: Filter by city and category
3. **Display Results**: Show in responsive layout
4. **Handle Selection**: Navigate to campaign details

## Web-Specific Optimizations

### Icon Handling
- Custom `WebIcon` component with emoji fallbacks
- No dependency on react-native-vector-icons
- Maintains visual consistency across platforms

### Responsive Layout
- Desktop: Side-by-side map and list (768px+)
- Mobile: Stacked layout with scrollable content
- Adaptive filter controls and spacing

### Performance
- Efficient filtering with useMemo potential
- Lazy loading ready for large datasets
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management

## Integration Points

### Services Used
- `CampaignRepository`: Data fetching
- `LocationService`: City and category management
- `ZyroLogo`: Branding component

### Components Used
- `CategoryFilter`: Category selection
- `CitySelector`: City selection
- Standard React Native components (View, Text, etc.)

## Future Map Integration

### Recommended Libraries
1. **Google Maps JavaScript API**
   - Pros: Rich features, familiar UX
   - Cons: Requires API key, usage costs

2. **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap**
   - Pros: Free, lightweight, customizable
   - Cons: Less features than Google Maps

3. **Mapbox GL JS**
   - Pros: Beautiful styling, good performance
   - Cons: Usage-based pricing

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Basic map with markers
2. **Phase 2**: Clustering and custom markers
3. **Phase 3**: Interactive features (zoom to bounds, etc.)
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (directions, street view)

## Styling Guidelines

### Theme Integration
- Uses consistent color scheme from theme.ts
- Follows spacing and typography standards
- Maintains brand identity with gold accents

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px
- Desktop/Tablet: >= 768px
- Large screens: >= 1200px (future enhancement)

## Testing Considerations
